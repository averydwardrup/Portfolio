                    <p>Everybody has a story. Why they are where they are, why they chose this field over that field. Mine started my freshman year of high school. I had been a big jock my whole life never knew any other way until that year. I had taken this keyboarding class to get an easy A; little did I know I wasn't the only one.</p>

                    <p>It was a popular class for upper classmen so I was one of the few freshmen in there. Class was going good until about the third week of class or so we had to turn something in via electronic mail. I had not the slightest clue how to access e-mail had never used it and hadn't planned on it either. Slowly I raised my hand asking shyly, how do I do that. The class soon became ablaze at my inquiry. I was ridiculed that day and many days to follow. Even though I was embarrassed terribly that day it taught me a lesson. Always keep an open mind, you never know what the future has to bring.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>After my freshman year I decided to step outside the confines of my jock ways and learn as much about computers as I could. So I took as many computer related classes as I could for the following years. Finally my senior year as a Wildcat at Henry County High School I had 3 computer related classes, Web Design being one of them. It was love at first sight, I couldn't believe its capabilities, and I was so amazed I wanted to learn as much as I possibly could about it. After my senior year I decided that one year wasn't enough I wanted to continue my education and it was in Web Design that I wanted to do it in. So in a way that's why I am where I am today because of all those buttheads that laughed at me that day. Thanks guys you helped me more than you could ever have imagined.</p>
